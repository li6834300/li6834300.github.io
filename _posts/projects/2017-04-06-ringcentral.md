I joined RingCentral at Oct. 2015 as a Front-end Engineer. RingCentral, as a big Silicon-Vally-based company, encourages employees to explore under the deep water to grab a better understanding of how to organize a project. Besides basic coding, I learned how to organize project with scrum methodology, ATTD process, and project deploy management. After working here, I improved my code style, communication skill, cross-team collaboration, and problem solving skills
