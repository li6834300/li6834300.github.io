This is the first completed game I did during my sophomore year. The background was based on my undergraduate campus.

I did this game for my interests. Everything was learned form level 0. I used a RPG game framework, called RPG maker, to design character, draw every map, and defined the events and event triggers. The whole 2 - 3 hour game was finished within 5 days morning to night and night to the morning. I am pretty proud of making this game happened
