I learned HTML, CSS, and JS all by myself and also participated some application development. This one was the first site that I have to organizeï¼Œ design, and code independently.

## {{page.title}}

![Portfolio]({{ site.url }}/images/projectImg/portfolio_1.jpg){:class="content-img-left"}

It gave me pretty much hands on experience working with jQuery, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML language. I manipulated some advantage code from other masters and used on my webpage. My design in the future will be better looking and more objected-oriented!
