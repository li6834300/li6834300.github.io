My major, Integrated Digital Media, led me think of the concept of interaction and user experience. These are two of the projects I designed in my first semester. In the Gesture Game project I used a color recognition code and sound detection code to make it interactive. In the program, my team designed an immersive virtual campus environment.

The Gesture Game allows players to control game characters with real world objects. The project offers a virtual reality tour guide for new students who visit NYU Poly campus. The school can also publish news and events on the event board. It could also work as a virtual reality social network platform.
