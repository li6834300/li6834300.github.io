During my academic years, I spent a lot of time working on the interactive concept. While I was working at Evolving Technologies Corporation, my colleagues and I developed several interactive web application by using JavaScript and Unity 3D engine, including 3D earthquake data visualization, Story tree, and Leap Motion helicopter.

Unity 3D is a game design engine that integrated many interactive functions. The 3D Earthquake Data Visualization Web App allows users to visualize earthquake data from the USGS database in an interactive 3D environment. Each little spot on the sphere represents an earthquake that happens recently, and the color represents the magnitude of earthquake. Users can rotate the sphere to observe the data from different angle and read more details in the GUI window by clicking on the earthquake spots. What’s more, the app was synchronized on the database which means different users can share the same observation view on the sphere. This app and the Leap Motion helicopter were connected with Leap Motion by using the data exchange from web page to the Unity web player. Story tree is a web app that allows people to read and branch out stories in a tree style story board. Users can read a certain branch of story, keep writing the story or start a new branch at the junction point they like. The stories can be either text or picture. People can also “Like” share and publish the story after log in with social network account.
