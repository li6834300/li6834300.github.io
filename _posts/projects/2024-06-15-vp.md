My main responsibilities and accomplishments for the virtual patient project included:

- **Project Concept & Research:**
    * Conducted in-depth research on integrating virtual patient scenarios in medical education.
    * Collaborated with clinical experts to determine critical decision points and realistic patient responses.
    * Developed a comprehensive simulation design document detailing user interactions and learning outcomes

- **Iterative Testing & Feedback:**
    * Coordinated with faculty and students to conduct multiple testing phases.
    * Gathered user feedback and iteratively refined the simulation for improved accuracy and usability.
    * Documented system updates and release notes throughout various project phases.

- **Outcomes & Impact:**
    * Enhanced students' engagement and clinical decision-making capabilities.
    * Achieved a measurable improvement in knowledge acquisition and transfer, as evidenced in pilot studies.
    * Provided a scalable simulation framework adaptable for other medical courses.
