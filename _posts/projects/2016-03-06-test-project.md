I hand crafted my own marriage website with Bootstrap. To make life easier, my marriage service website integrated Email service, and WeChat app design system. My website helped me managing guest registrations, delivering invitation letters, planning events, and exhibiting photos.

The first time in my life I became the project owner(Of course). The I find out that I am developer, designer, project manager, and QA myself. This was a great expericence to work on a project as a whole. Web development is a part of the whole project. I had to think of the apparance of the website and make decision of using which funcations and libraries. What's more, besides booking place and prepare wedding details, collecting information and delivering invitation letters tasks are also on me. I integrated MailChimp to collect user infromation and created a WeChat App to delivering the wedding invitation letters.
