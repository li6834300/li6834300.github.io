Xiao Ran recently started using AI tools to assist with homework. Whether it’s writing reflections for a language arts class or researching historical events, she turns to ChatGPT for instant answers. If the results aren’t satisfactory, she switches to DeepSeek for additional materials from different angles. At first, she thought these tools were “learning miracles”—no more flipping through books or browsing endless web pages, and answers appeared to be at her fingertips.

However, after a while, Xiao Ran found herself increasingly reliant on “copy and paste.” She stopped questioning whether the information was accurate or credible. While finishing assignments became easier, when it came to class discussions or writing her own viewpoints in exams, she struggled—unable to recall the reasoning behind the gathered information and failing to form her own opinions.

Such challenges aren’t unique to Xiao Ran. As ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and other AI tools gradually enter households worldwide, some parents remain on the fence while many enthusiastically embrace this digital wave. But how exactly should we use AI to help children learn? Is it ultimately beneficial or harmful? More importantly, in the AI era, what skills should we instill so that learners can truly master their studies rather than become overly dependent on technology?

## AI Tools and Learning: Surface Convenience Versus Deeper Risks

Many hold high hopes that AI will “empower” learning—that if students can ask AI questions anytime and receive instant answers, learning efficiency will soar. In fact, this kind of “tech optimism” was already seen during the rise of multimedia learning: the internet made almost all educational resources accessible, open courses brought top-tier classrooms online, and short videos fostered “fragmented learning.”

Yet, as research indicates, merely providing digital resources does not automatically lead to improved learning outcomes (Means, Toyama, Murphy, Bakia, & Jones, 2009). Those who show significant progress with online resources often already have strong self-monitoring and self-regulation skills, the very heart of SRL (Self-Regulated Learning; Schunk & Zimmerman, 1998). For most lacking sufficient self-regulation, advanced tools alone seldom produce lasting benefits.

## It’s Not About the Tools, But About “Self-Regulation”

Many mistakenly equate SRL with "studying alone"—assuming that simply reading or researching independently qualifies as self-regulated learning. In reality, the essence of SRL lies in "regulation": consciously planning your learning process, continually adjusting strategies, and reflecting on learning outcomes, rather than merely working in isolation.

Research shows that learners who lack awareness and management of their own cognition often end up skimming through information or “jumping around” online (Winne & Hadwin, 1998). Thus, improved learning outcomes hinge more on whether learners actively assess and adjust their learning strategies rather than on the technology itself.

## Metacognition: The Foundation of Self-Regulated Learning

Metacognition is the awareness and control of one’s own thought and learning processes. Many people misunderstand learning—for example, they work tirelessly yet in the wrong direction or blindly adopt someone else’s “miracle method” without understanding their own needs (Zimmerman, 2002). Often, the difference in outcomes stems from how well individuals can perceive and monitor their own learning.

SRL helps learners recognize and refine their strategies—for instance, by reflecting on whether their current approach is effective and then selecting appropriate tools or methods. This iterative cycle builds a personal roadmap for learning that ultimately leads to mastery.

## Sowing the Seed of SRL: A Path to Continuous Exploration

Cultivating self-regulated learning isn’t an overnight process—it is gradual and highly personalized. I hope this article plants a seed of SRL in your mind and inspires you to shift from passive reception to active engagement in your learning journey. In future posts, I will share more research-based SRL techniques and practices.

In our rapidly changing, information-saturated era, only by continuously developing self-regulation skills can we truly harness AI tools and steer our learning back toward thoughtful, ongoing improvement. May we all find the key to our personal growth on this journey.
